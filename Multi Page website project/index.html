        <p1 style = "text-align: center"> If you're looking to begin riding motorbikes and don't know what motorbike to buy, this website will cover a few options
            and inform you about the most popular motorbikes available in the 500cc-700cc range. What you must do first is get your motorcycle license
            and it is a good idea to get your motorcycle gear before buying your motorbike so you can get on the road immediately after insuring your bike.
            You must be willing to fork out a decent amount of money when buying a motorbike, motorbikes themselves can be affordable, but when you factor in 
            the cost of gear, insurance and tax, not to mention repairs if you're buying a used bike, quite a decent chunk of money will be required. Once you've got 
            all of that sorted, the next step will be to pick a motorbike brand to start your journey with. In this website we will go over the "Big Four" so to speak.
            All four of these brands are the titans of both Japanese motorbike manufacturing and motorbike manufacturing in general. These are Kawasaki, Yamaha, Honda
            and Suzuki. For a beginner like you most likely are if you're reading this, I would highly recommend starting with Yamaha or Suzuki as they are the most
            affordable and reliable, while providing a good bang for your buck. Read more on the seperate sections of this website dedicated to the specific brands.
