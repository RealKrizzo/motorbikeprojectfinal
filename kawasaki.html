        <p2 style = "text-align: left"> The ZX-6R is one of the longest-serving supersport motorbikes available today,
            it has been around for 21 years this year. It has only been outlasted by two other motorbikes, the Honda CB600R
            and the Suzuki GSXR600 which we talk about on their corresponding pages of this website if you'd like to learn more about those.
            The ZX-6R runs a liquid-cooled 4 stroke engine with a maximum power of 91kW at 13,000 RPM. The 2025 model has an Electric starting 
            system with a Digital ignition system. The ZX-6R burns 6.1l of petrol/100km which can be considered a lot when compared to smaller engine
            motorbikes but is pretty average when it comes to 600cc bikes.
